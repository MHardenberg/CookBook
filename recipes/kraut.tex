\section{Sauerkraut}{
\begin{itemize}
        \item 1 cabbage
        \item 3/2 to 2 teaspoons of salt per 500g of cabbage.
        \item herbs: I reccomend mustard seeds and juniper.
\end{itemize}

        Rise cabbage thoroughly. Then cut into small pieces - 
        leaving one leaf per glas aside. 

        Mix the cut cabbage with the salt and let it rest for 
        at least a quarter of an hour. Then stomp / massage it 
        for several minutes. A considerable amount pof liquid 
        should be release. Add any extra herbs you like.

        When placing the cabbage in sterile glasses, cover it with
        this liquid. You can now use the leftover leaf to cover
        the cabbage. You can weigh it down further by adding a 
        clean rock on top.

        Let it ferment for 1 to 4 weeks at roomtemperature 
        depending on taste. You can check it regularly.
