        \begin{itemize}
                \item Onions
                \item Stock
                \item Filler vegtables (carrot, potato, celery root)
                \item Protein (e.g. beans, lentils, meat, fish)
                \item Taste givers (e.g. pickles, garlic, capers, celery stick
                or leaves)
                \item salt, pepper and bayleave, maybe dill.
        \end{itemize}
        Fry onions and potentially meat. Add vegtables and gently fry until
        glassy. Add water, stock, bay leave and let it boil. Add taste givers, 
        and vegatable that should remain firm and plenty of salt and pepper.
        
        Finish boiling to desired consistency and serve with bread, buckwheat,
        boiled barley, rice or macaroni.

        This is the most customisable recipe and is a great fall back for 
        whatever you have leaft in your fridge.
