\section{European, Reasonably Fast Noodles}{
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bouillon cube or powder - stock also works.
    \item The thinnest pasta you can buy. Something like Macaroni also works
      - but need to be boiled.
    \item Any vegetables you have.
    \item Garlic
    \item Cooking oil
  \end{itemize}

  Chop veggies and garlic into smallest possible pieces add to
  boiling water with
  bouillon cube and oil. Add noodles, and let it sit under a lid for
  a few minutes.
