  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prefer boiling over frying food, if you have little of it.
    \item Unpack carrot and potatos so that they dry instead of spoiling
    \item Prefer basic seasoning - you don't want to overpower the
      natural flavour
      of the ingredients.
    \item Add salt early - herbs and pepper late or after adding
      water to preserve flavour.
    \item In soup salt the water to the desired degree. Everthing will be salted
      thus.
    \item Never fry garlic if you want garlic taste.
    \item Salads are a waste of money - they don't fill you, go bad easy, and
      your body is bad at breaking down uncooked vegtables anyways.
    \item Don't buy milk unless you specifically need it. Oats
      are fine without. We're living in a recession.
    \item slight variations can make you think you eat different meals.
    \item Prefer course oats and wholegrain flour as they are more filling.
    \item Olive oil is for the upper class.
    \item Always boil extra rice, potato or pasta for later use.
